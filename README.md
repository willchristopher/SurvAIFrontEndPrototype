# SurvAIFrontEndPrototype
Welcome to the frontend repo for SurvAI, a project for CSC 385 at Murray State University. Here, you will find all the necessary files and uploads to run a prototype version of ServAI's frontend programming. Main features include a welcome page highlighting features, a demo login, demo dashboard, and demo survey builder. Tenny, the AI assistant that will help users, is currently inactive and will only display demo messages. All information seen is for demo purposes only. If a button does or page does not do anything when refreshed or pressed, it has not been coded yet. We hope you enjoy this sneek peak at what we are creating, and if you have any questions, let us know. Thanks!
